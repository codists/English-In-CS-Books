# manifesto

1.manifestus: manus("hand") + festus"grasp(to quickly take sth)"

2.manifesto: manifestus + -o(suffix used in Latin nouns)

"Manifestus" originally conveyed the idea of something being grasped by hand， Over time, the term evolved into "manifesto," which refers to a public declaration of intentions, opinions, or goals—essentially making something clear or evident to others.

c. a written statement that makes ideas clear and visible to the public.

示例：In 1985, Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, which argues that all software should be free(《Operating System Concepts》第 45 页)。

# marshal

1.marshaling

Marshalling or marshaling(US spelling) is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object into a data form suitable for storage or transmission, especially between different runtimes.

2.marshaled

The CPython interpreter will evaluate and execute a code object fetched from either the marshaled .pyc file or the compiler(《Python Internals》第151页)。

3.marshaling vs serialization

这两个词我在阅读中经常会遇到，它们的区别是什么呢？我还没有搞清楚，现在先mark汇总，后续再做总结。

Marshaling is about getting parameters from here to there, while serialization is about copying structured data to or from a primitive form such as a byte stream. 

# maskable

1.mask: masque("a covering for hidding or guarding the face")

2.maskable: mask + -able("capable of being")

adj. capable of being masked(hidden or blocked)，可屏蔽的。

3.nonmaskable: non- + maskable

示例：Most CPUs have two interrupt request lines. One is the nonmaskable interrupt, which is reserved for events such as unrecoverable memory errors. The second interrupt line is maskable: it can be turned off by the CPU before the execution of critical instruction sequences that must not be interrupted(《Operating System Concepts》第 10 页)。

# median

c. the value that is the middle one in a set of values arranged in order of size(中位数，中值)。示例：1.假设有一组数 1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9， 那么 median 是6。2.假设有一组数1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9，那么 median 是(4+5)/2=4.5。

A benchmark will produce an average/median runtime of a fixed code snippet so that you can compare multiple versions of Python runtime（《CPython Internals》第353页。）

# myriad

1.myriad: myrias("ten thousand")

c/adj. Originally, myriad refered to the number ten thousand(10,000), but over time, it came to mean a very larege or countless number of sth.

示例：By now, you can probably see that the term operating system covers many roles and functions. That is the case, at least in part, because of the myriad designs and uses of computers(《Operating System Concepts》第5页)。
