# marshal

1.marshaling

Marshalling or marshaling(US spelling) is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object into a data form suitable for storage or transmission, especially between different runtimes.

2.marshaled

The CPython interpreter will evaluate and execute a code object fetched from either the marshaled .pyc file or the compiler(《Python Internals》第151页)。

3.marshaling vs serialization

这两个词我在阅读中经常会遇到，它们的区别是什么呢？我还没有搞清楚，现在先mark汇总，后续再做总结。

Marshaling is about getting parameters from here to there, while serialization is about copying structured data to or from a primitive form such as a byte stream. 

# maskable

1.mask: masque("a covering for hidding or guarding the face")

2.maskable: mask + -able("capable of being")

adj. capable of being masked(hidden or blocked)，可屏蔽的。

3.nonmaskable: non- + maskable

示例：Most CPUs have two interrupt request lines. One is the nonmaskable interrupt, which is reserved for events such as unrecoverable memory errors. The second interrupt line is maskable: it can be turned off by the CPU before the execution of critical instruction sequences that must not be interrupted(《Operating System Concepts》第 10 页)。

# median

c. the value that is the middle one in a set of values arranged in order of size(中位数，中值)。示例：1.假设有一组数 1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9， 那么 median 是6。2.假设有一组数1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9，那么 median 是(4+5)/2=4.5。

A benchmark will produce an average/median runtime of a fixed code snippet so that you can compare multiple versions of Python runtime（《CPython Internals》第353页。）
