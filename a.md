# ask

- be asking for it/trouble(自找麻烦)

However, for applications where security matters, we are asking for trouble if we assume that the source or destination address of a packet reliably determines who sent or received that packet(《Operating System Concepts》第 638 页)。

# accommodate

- accommodate: ad-("to") + com- + modus("measure, manner")

vt. to provide what is needed。这个词在中文中不大好翻译。

- 示例

When an operating system accommodates multiple users, the issues of file sharing, file naming, and file protection become preeminent(《Operating System Concepts》第 603 页)。

在上面这个例子中，accomodate 可以理解为“operating system support functionality of serving multiple users at the same time””，整句话的意思是“当操作系统支持多用户时，文件共享、文件命名和文件保护就会变得至关重要”。

# acyclic

- acyclic: a-("not") + cylic(参考 cycle)

adj. involve a cycle(环状的)。

- 示例

An acyclic graph—that is, a graph with no cycles—allows directories to share subdirectories and files(《Operating System Concepts》第 547 页)。

# adverse

- adverse: ad-("toward, against") + vetere("to turn")

adj. Adverse literally means "to turn against(反对)，opposing(相反的)". having a negative or harmful effect on sth(负面的，不利的)。

- 示例

Obviously, if two readers access the shared data simultaneously, no adverse effects will result(《Operating System Concepts》第 291 页)。

# affinity

- affinity: ad-("to") + finis("a border, a boundry", 参考 finish("to bring to an end")) 

c/u. a natural connection(亲缘性), attraction(亲和力) or relationship(密切关系)。

语法结构：A have an affinity for/with B。

# al-

- suffix forming adjectives from nouns, "of, like, related to, pertaining to"。

示例：

1. nature > natural(relating to nature, 天然的) > natural disaster(自然灾害)

- suffix forming nouns of action from verbs. "act of xxx"

示例：

vt. divide or distribute as by lots(分配)。

- allotment

c/u. the acting of allot.

- 示例

From a user’s perspective, a file is the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage; that is, data cannot be written to secondary storage unless they are within a file(《Operating System Concepts》第 530 页)。

# approximation

- approximate: ad-("to") + proximus("nearest")

vi/vt. to be almost the same as. adj. not completely accurate but close(大概的).

- approximation: noun of action from approximate

# automaton & automata

- automaton: auto-("self") + matos("thinking, willing")

c. an automaton originally referred to something that moves or operates by itself(自动机).

The CPython parser was rewritten in Python 3.9 from a parser table automaton (the pgen module) into a contextual grammar parser(注：《CPython Internals》第 69 页)。

因为这里是一种自动机，所以使用的是 automaton。

- automata

automata 是 automaton 的复数形式。有一本很有名的计算机教材名字叫做《Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation》(自动机理论、语言和计算导论)。

当讨论 multiple machines, general theory 时使用automata, 虽然从中文角度来说意思都一样，都是指“自动机”。
