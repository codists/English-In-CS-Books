- allot: ad-("to") + lot("portion(比例), share(份额)")

vt. divide or distribute as by lots(分配)。

The CPython parser was rewritten in Python 3.9 from a parser table automaton (the pgen module) into a contextual grammar parser(注：《CPython Internals》第 69 页)。

因为这里是一种自动机，所以使用的是 automaton。

- automata

automata 是 automaton 的复数形式。有一本很有名的计算机教材名字叫做《Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation》(自动机理论、语言和计算导论)。

当讨论 multiple machines, general theory 时使用automata, 虽然从中文角度来说意思都一样，都是指“自动机”。
