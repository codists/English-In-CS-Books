# capability

- capable: capere("to grasp, take, catch")

  **"capable"** originally referred to being able to grasp, hold, or handle something, and its meaning evolved to signify having the ability or capacity to do something.

- capability: capable + -ity(word-forming element making abstract nouns from adjectives and meaning "condition or quality of being )

1. c/u. ability to do something(能力，才干)。



2. c/u. A feature or function that makes something able to perform a specific task(功能)。

示例：Master CPython’s memory management capabilities(注：《CPython Internals》第 14 页)。这句话应该理解为“掌握 CPython 的内存管理功能”。我遇到好几本书有这个用法，如果理解为”能力“则不大准确。

# compiler-compiler 

1.定义

tools used to generate compilers。也称为compiler generator。在一些不严谨的表述中，本来应该属于 parser generator的工具也称为 compiler generator——Well first the term compiler-compiler has been degraded to include parser generators. I blame that on yacc(yet another compiler-compiler) calling itself a compiler compiler. 

2.示例

 META II, TREEMETA, CWIC。

# check

vi/vt. to exam sth to ensure it is correct, true, or in good condition.示例：

1.After I'd finished the test, I checked my answers for mistakes.

这种用法比较常见。

2.Unlike PEP 8, there are few tools for checking compliance with PEP 7(注：《CPython Internals》第78页).

在这里，compliance 的意思是 following rules or standards，Unlike PEP 8 (Python's style guide for code), there are fewer tools available to check if your code adheres to or follows the standards set by PEP 7 (the style guide for C code in CPython).
