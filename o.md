## overhead

## 1.overhead: over-("above") + head(“top part, uppermost section”)

overhead的字面意思是：above the head,后来演变成"represent things situated above or metaphorically referring to additional costs".

adv. above the head. 

adj. operating, lying, or comming from above. 示例: This room needs overhead lighting(这个房间需要顶灯).

n(c/u). business expenses(such as rent, insurance, or heating)not chargeable to a particular of the work.

## 2.overhead costs vs direct costs

direct costs(直接支出/直接开销/直接成本)：Costs that can be directly traced to a specific product(Example: raw materials, labor costs).

overhead costs(间接支出/间接开销/间接成本，同 indirect costs):  Costs that can be not directly traced to a specific product but are necessary for general operations(Example: rent, insurance, heating)。

在计算机书籍里面，overhead 大多表示的也是“overhead costs”这个意思，会被笼统的翻译成“开销”。

Because the CPython interpreter process has a significant overhead, the Pool will consider each process in the pool a worker. If a worker has completed, it will be reused(《CPython Internals》第232页)。
