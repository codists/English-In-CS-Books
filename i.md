# indefinitely

- indefinite: in-("not") + definitus("defined, set limite"，参考 definite)。

adj. not exact(不确定的), without clear limit(无限期的)。

- indefinitely: indefinite + -ly

adv. for a period of time with no fixed end(不确定地，无限期地)。

示例：A process waiting indefinitely under the circumstances just described is an example of a “liveness failure.”(《Operating System Concepts》第 283 页)。

# imperative &  imperatively

- imperative: im-("in") + parare("to arrange, prepare, ")

  adj. This root reflects the idea of authority or necessity, which aligns with the meaning of "imperative" as something crucial or commanding(命令)。

- imperatively

  adv. in a way that is expressed as an order。

  示例：`kubectl scale --replicas 5 deployment/qsk-deploy`——Performing scaling operations imperatively with the kubectl scale command can be dangerous.

  在上面这个示例中，为什么用“imperatively”呢？因为前面是使用命令(kubectl scale)进行操作的。

# intermediary

- intermediary: inter-("between, among") + medius("middle")

**c.** intermediary originally referred to something or someone that is "in the middle" or acts as a "go-between."(媒介)。

- 示例

An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware(《Operating System Concepts》第1页。 

# intermediate

- intermediate: inter-(“between, among”) + medius("middle")

​	**adj.**  being or occuring in the middle(中间的).

- 示例

​	(1)The interrupt routine is called indirectly through the table, with no intermediate routine needed(《Operating System Concepts(tenth edition)》第9页).

​	(2)There are three levels of difficulty in this game: low, intermediate, and high.

# inversion

- invert: in-("in") + vertere("to turn")

vt. to turn sth upside down(使颠倒)。

- inversion： act of inverting

- **invert vs reverse**

这两个词不好区分在于都包含 "opposite" 之意，目前我也没找到什么比较好的区分特征，先记录。

invert: turn upside down，turn inside out；flip。

示例1： the number 9 looks like an inverted 6

reverse: change in order, side, direction；reorder。

示例1： 

Consider a list of two fractions: 1/2, 3/4.

If you invert the fractions: 2/1, 4/3.

If you reverse the fractions: 3/4, 1/2.
