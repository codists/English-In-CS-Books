# illusion

- illusion:in-("in") + ludere("to play")

c/u. a false perception(感知，感觉) by the senses(错觉，幻觉)。

- 示例

The fundamental idea behind a virtual machine is to abstract the hardware of a single computer (the CPU, memory, disk drives, network interface cards, and so forth) into several different execution environments, thereby creating the illusion that each separate environment is running on its own private computer(《Operating System Concepts》第 701 页)。

# immediate caller(直接调用者)

- immediate: im-("not, opposite of") + mediate("in the middle")

adj. nearest in space or relationship, with nothing interposed(直接的)。

Generators have a major limitation: they can yield values only to their immediate caller(《CPython Internals》第272页)。

每次看到 immediate, intermediate, mediate 这三个单词我就犯迷糊，这里梳理一下。

# imperative &  imperatively

- imperative: im-("in") + parare("to arrange, prepare, ")

  adj. This root reflects the idea of authority or necessity, which aligns with the meaning of "imperative" as something crucial or commanding(命令)。

- imperatively

  adv. in a way that is expressed as an order。


- 示例

1.`kubectl scale --replicas 5 deployment/qsk-deploy`——Performing scaling operations imperatively with the kubectl scale command can be dangerous.

在上面这个示例中，为什么用“imperatively”呢？因为前面是使用命令(kubectl scale)进行操作的。

2.Imperative language(procedual language): Language for implementing algorithms that are state-based (e.g., C, C++, Java, and C#).

# impose

- impose: in-("in") + pose("to put, to place")

vt. impose literally means to "to forcefully place sth on sth else"; force sth to be accepted(强制实行，施加)。

注：一般来说，虽然 impose 暗含 forcefully 之意，但翻译的时候， forcefully 可不用译出来。

- 示例

The original implementation of SMP imposed the restriction that only one processor at a time could be executing kernel code.(《Operating System Concepts》第 794 页)。

上面这句话的意思是：SMP的最初实现施加了一个限制：同一时间只能有一个处理器执行内核代码。

# in-(词根)

in- 和某些词组合的时候为了发音方便 n 会变化。示例：

- illusion: in- + ludere

# indefinitely

- indefinite: in-("not") + definitus("defined, set limite"，参考 definite)。

adj. not exact(不确定的), without clear limit(无限期的)。

- indefinitely: indefinite + -ly

adv. for a period of time with no fixed end(不确定地，无限期地)。

示例：A process waiting indefinitely under the circumstances just described is an example of a “liveness failure.”(《Operating System Concepts》第 283 页)。

# interconnect

- interconnect: inter-("between, among") + connect

vi/vt. connect with each other.

- 示例

To completely understand the roles and types of distributed systems in use today, we need to understand the networks that interconnect them(《Operating System Concepts》第 735 页)。

- connect vs interconnect

1. connect is used for two object.

2. interconnect is used for multiple objects.

# intermediary

- intermediary: inter-("between, among") + medius("middle")

**c.** intermediary originally referred to something or someone that is "in the middle" or acts as a "go-between."(媒介)。

- 示例

An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware(《Operating System Concepts》第1页。 

# intermediate

- intermediate: inter-(“between, among”) + medius("middle")

​	**adj.**  being or occuring in the middle(中间的).

- 示例

​	(1)The interrupt routine is called indirectly through the table, with no intermediate routine needed(《Operating System Concepts(tenth edition)》第9页).

​	(2)There are three levels of difficulty in this game: low, intermediate, and high.

# intervention

- intervene: inter-("between, among") + venire("to  come")

vi. intervene literally means "to come between(to step in, mediate or interface in a situation), 干涉"。

- intervention

- 示例

Consistency checking can require human intervention to resolve conflicts, and that is inconvenient if no human is available(《Operating System Concepts》第 587 页)。

# inversion

- invert: in-("in") + vertere("to turn")

vt. to turn sth upside down(使颠倒)。

- inversion： act of inverting

- **invert vs reverse**

这两个词不好区分在于都包含 "opposite" 之意，目前我也没找到什么比较好的区分特征，先记录。

invert: turn upside down，turn inside out；flip。

示例1： the number 9 looks like an inverted 6

reverse: change in order, side, direction；reorder。

示例1： 

Consider a list of two fractions: 1/2, 3/4.

If you invert the fractions: 2/1, 4/3.

If you reverse the fractions: 3/4, 1/2.

# -ive

word-forming element making adjectives from verbs, meaning "pertaining to, tending to; doing, serving to do,"。
