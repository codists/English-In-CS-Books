# imperative &  imperatively

- imperative: im-("in") + parare("to arrange, prepare, ")

  adj. This root reflects the idea of authority or necessity, which aligns with the meaning of "imperative" as something crucial or commanding(命令)。

- imperatively

  adv. in a way that is expressed as an order。

  示例：`kubectl scale --replicas 5 deployment/qsk-deploy`——Performing scaling operations imperatively with the kubectl scale command can be dangerous.

  在上面这个示例中，为什么用“imperatively”呢？因为前面是使用命令(kubectl scale)进行操作的。
