# time

- most of the time

可以直接做副词使用，意思是"usually, very often"。示例：Moderate contention is particularly interesting to examine. In this scenario, the CAS operation succeeds most of the time, and when it fails, it will iterate through the loop shown in Figure 6.8 only a few times before ultimately succeeding(《《Operating System Concepts》第 286 页》)。

# transaction

- 英语中的意思

c/u. trans-("across") + agere("to drive, do, peform")。the act of perform sth across parties(交易)。

- 编程中的意思

Generally, the execution of a set of steps that make up one activity.

- 示例

TBD。

# transient

- transitent: trans-("across, beyond") + ire("to go")

adj. lasting for only a short time; temporary(短暂的，暂时性的)。Transient means literally "go across", which implies "pass through sth rather than staying"。

- 示例

Devices and I/O transfers can fail in many ways, either for transient reasons, as when a network becomes overloaded, or for “permanent” reasons, as when a disk controller becomes defective(《Operating System Concepts》第 512 页)。

# trillion

- trillion: tri-("three") + million

c. 这涉及到长级差制(long scale)和短级差制(short scale)，现在主要使用短级差制。在长级差制中， 即 the number 1,000,000,000,000(10^18，十万亿)。在短级差制，因为是以 1000 为单位累进，billion 就变成了 10^12(万亿)，这样就出现了单词词根与实际值的分离，以 10^3 去记忆：(10^3， thousand)x10^(3+1)。

# trivial

- trivial: ("three") + via("road")

adj. Trivial is from trivialis("a place three roads meet"), over time, trivial means "having little value and importance(微不足道的)"。

Designing such applications is not a trivial undertaking: programmers must address not only the challenges outlined in Section 4.2 but additional difficulties as well(《Operating System Concepts》第 177 页)。
